# Introduction #

I'm a software engineer living and working in Northern Virginia.  I
was a theoretical physicist in a past life.

# Hobbies #

I have two young children at home, so I don't have a lot of free time
to pursue hobbies right now.  If I did have time, though, these are
the things I would be doing...

* Reading ("serious" literature, science and mathematics, history,
  ...)
* Learning Latin, Classical Greek, and Esperanto
* Improving my French and German
* Watching weird foreign films
* Playing the guitar
* Hiking
* Traveling
* Expanding my home network/computer lab setup
* Building, programming, and tinkering with custom hardware
