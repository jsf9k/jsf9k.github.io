# Introduction #

I'm a software engineer living and working in Northern Virginia.  I
was a theoretical physicist in a past life.

# Hobbies #

I have a toddler at home, so I don't have a lot of free time to pursue
hobbies right now.  If I did have time, though, this are the things I
would be doing...

* Reading ("serious" literature, science fiction, historical fiction,
  science and mathematics, history, ...)
* Watching weird foreign films
* Playing the guitar
* Hiking
* Traveling
* Expanding my home network/computer lab setup
* Building, programming, and tinkering with custom hardware
