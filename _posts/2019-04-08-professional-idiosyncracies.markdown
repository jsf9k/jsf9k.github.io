* I'm old school.  I use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
  and the command line whenever possible.
* I use Linux exclusively both at home and at work.
* I don't want eye candy cluttering up my screen, so I use
  [Ratpoison](https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/) as my window manager.
  Ratpoison is essentially
  [`screen`](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) for X.  I generally
  have just Emacs, a terminal, and a browser running, each in a
  full-screen window.
* I've found that using [a buckling-spring
  keyboard](https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/UNI0P4A) and [a
  trackball](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/control/trackballs/expert-mouse-wired-trackball/)
  (instead of a mouse) helps reduce the frequency of my RSI flareups.
  Using Ratpoison also helps, since it is a keyboard-driven window
  manager.
* When I find myself in a shared workspace I use [a keyboard with
  Cherry MX Clears](https://codekeyboards.com/).  I find those
  switches simulate the tactile feedback I like without deafening
  everyone around me.
* I don't like strongly opinionated frameworks like
  [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) that magically do things for you
  and hide all the complexity from the developer.  I like to know and
  understand what is going on under the hood.
* At the same time, I'm a big fan of adopting an opinionated linter
  such as [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for each
  project.  I want my projects to have a consistent coding style, but
  I don't want to spend time negotiating what that style should look
  like.
